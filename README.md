# Microfrontends POC

A relatively simple application, a POC to test the so called "Microfrontends" architecture (inspiration: [https://micro-frontends.org/](https://micro-frontends.org/)).
Based on native WebComponents (with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/)).

Uses [Rushjs](https://rushjs.io/) to manage monorepo structure.
